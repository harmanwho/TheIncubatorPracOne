### Use Case
#### Contact Tracing DBMS for grades 9-12 boarding school

* Description: This use case is being implemented because it presents an opportunity to build a system within the specific / unique constraints of a residential school. The expected outcome of this use case is for boarding school administrators to be able to accurately and efficiently track the spread of COVID-19 through the campus and take appropriate measures such as the imposition of quarantine to mitigate the spread of the virus. 

* Actors:
  + Database Architects: A. Daccache, H. Sidhu, R. Zipp for CS5200 F2020.
  + Secondary Actors: School administrators, student life professionals, and school nurse's offices.  
  
* Precondition: All students, faculty, and staff should be assigned a unique School ID and accounted for in the DMBS. The school nurse's office must have the capacity to administer COVID-19 tests once every five days and the school should have the capacity to quarantine as many COVID-19 positive individuals as needed.

* Post-condition: DBMS successfully guides policy decisions regarding COVID-19 responses at the school without failing.

* Flow:
  + The structure of the school is outlined via data inserts to Building and SpaceRoom tables. 
  + Faculty, staff, and student information inserted into DB. 
  + Baseline medical records created for each entry.
  + Events such as classes and athletic events are scheduled and inserted into Events table. Attendees are recorded in EventAttendees table.
  + Entire school population is tested once every 5 days for COVID-19. Upon a positive diagnosis, the following protocols are activated:
    - Positive tests initiate creation of CaseID table and TreatmentPlan attribute associated with  MedicalID. People.IsQuar attribute is updated to "True" and reverts to False after 15 days have passed.
    - DBMS runs contact tracing query. Attendees of events where positive patient was also present are also quarantined with IsQuar = true.
  
* Alternative Flows: 
  + None to consider in this model. Possible future builds include protocols for moving patients off site to hospital.

* Exceptions:
  1. A quarantined person cannot attend events. 
  2. CaseID cannot be non-null without corresponding positive test result.
  3. People cannot attend events on the same day that begin at the same time.
  4. Group IDs (1 = student, 2 = faculty, 3 = staff) are final / immutable.
 
  
* Requirements: Assuming implementation in the United States, DBMS must be compliant with US privacy law, specifically the provisions of FERPA and HIPAA.

#### BCNF

1. First Normal Form
    i) None of the attributes hold multiple values
2. Second Normal Form
    i) No non-prime attribute is dependent on the proper subset of any candidate key
3. Third Normal Form
    i) Transitive functional dependency of non-prime attribute on any super key should be removed
    ii) For each functional dependency X->Y at least one of the following should hold:
        A. X i a super key of table
        B. Y is a prime attribute of table
4. BCNF (ie. 3.5NF)
    i) Example: created table 'EventAttendees' which acts as junction table to resolve functional dependencies
